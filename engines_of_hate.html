      <p><b>Engines of Hate</b> is a digital art project by DANT, the collection is now <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/dant-engines-of-hate" target="_blank">available on OpenSea</a>.</p>
      <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/dant-engines-of-hate" target="_blank"><img alt="Engines of Hate" src="eohb.png" /></a>
      <p>This is my first collection of NFT art, and really is just an attempt by me to understand the space and learn how to interact with it.</p>
      <p>This is an open ended, generative art project that I intend on adding to over time. I oversee the generative process, making tweaks and changes to evolve the output. Only output that I find aesthetically pleasing will be added to the collection.</p>
      <p>Currently, the generative process is using machine learning diffusion models, but this may change or be supplemented with other processes as the project evolves.</p>
      <p>I am attempting to add some minimal documentation on the process by using the OpenSea Properties & Stats.</p>
      <p>Here are a few Engines that I rejected for the collection, for various reasons, but which are still interesting to consider in the overall scope of the project. I have also created a Tumblr for <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/blog/engines-of-hate-rejects" target="_blank">Engines of Hate Rejections</a>.</p>
